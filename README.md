# MyLittleGreenhouse
A small homebrew project using a BME280 sensor and an ESP8266 microcontroller to provide real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and air pressure inside our greenhouse. This helps us maintain optimal growing conditions for our chili peppers and apple peppers, ensuring a healthier and more productive environment.
